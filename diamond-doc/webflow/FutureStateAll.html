<li><p>&quot;We are nowhere near best-in-class, but we are making progress,&quot; says Steve Rogers, UK managing director of SAP to an audience of his customers at the German applications firm's annual user gathering at the end of last year. It's not the kind of comment that you expect from a senior executive at a leading software firm.</p></li>

</ul>
<p>There is a huge amount that can be done but a specification has not been articulated.</p>
<p>Concepts must be articulated.</p>
<h2 id="simple-example">Simple Example</h2>
<p>During one of my calls with Peter he told me that he was reviewing purchase orders a simple line such as &quot;Buyers don''t buy the correct quantities to get a good price&quot; was extended to:</p>
<h3 id="compute-optimal-purchase-quantity">Compute Optimal Purchase Quantity</h3>
<p>Compute a projected per unit cost by solving the equation</p>
<p>unit_cost = (setup_cost / qty) + incremental cost</p>
<p>For two different known qty and prices (vendor quotes) using linear algebra</p>
<h3 id="graph-this-relationsihip">Graph this relationsihip</h3>
<p>Find the &quot;price knee&quot; the first derivative of the function, the slope of the tangent starts to level off (it asymptotically approaches 0, meaning the limit is the unit cost doesn''t decrease at all. Depending on setup cost, incremental cost and annual consumption a three year supply may be ten percent more than a one year supply, it may also be three times the acquisition cost and additional carrying costs must be considered.</p>
<p>Vendor quotes should include this range of quantities, purchasing quantities should be in this range, buys can be made and even scheduled so that lower per unit costs can be realized.</p>
<h2 id="purchasing-procedures">Purchasing Procedures</h2>
<p>When a part needs to be replenished</p>
<ol>
<li>Vendor quotes for the price range should be required.</li>
<li>Purchase amounts over a defined limit should be reviewed and approved.</li>
<li>Requisitions should be created in the new purchase decision application and once approved, be created as purchase orders in the execution system (Dymax and SAP).</li>
<li>Checks for any constraints including approved manufacturers should be simulated</li>
<li>Existing inventory carried under equivalent part numbers should be considered.</li>
</ol>
<p>The opportunities for process improvement are best addressed by evaluating your current processes and the issues your experts realize and developing a system to address those issues.</p>
<h2 id="constraints">Constraints</h2>
<p>Your new process should:</p>
<ol>
<li>Be external to SAP and Dymax, requiring no modifications to either system. This eliminates risk and complexity.</li>
<li>Should include data from both operations for inventory, purchases and demands</li>
<li>Incorporate new procedures and policies to reflect best practices</li>
<li>Reduce the effort of sales staff and purchasing staff to perform their functions</li>
<li>Define metrics to evaluate performance and progress</li>
<li>Have an alert system of reports of issues that need to be addressed.</li>
<li>Require no hardware or other infrastructure or the installation of any software on any Align computer.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="questions-1">Questions</h1>
<p>What is the current cost of</p>
<ol>
<li>Not buying the correct quantities</li>
<li>Not taking into consideration multiple certifications</li>
<li>Buying inventory in one operation that is excess inventory in the other operation</li>
<li>Time wasted gathering information to create a purchase order</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Align has the expertise in house to participate in the design of a business process and software to optimize the purchasing and sales operations, there is no need to wait for an IT person who has much less experience than your director of purchasing and other operations personnel.</p>
<p>A one hour phone call every two weeks is not going to ever get you a design.</p>
<p>I have no doubt that several times every day a sub-optimal purchase results in a expense greater than the cost of developing a design.</p>
<p>A design is best done by whiteboard meetings, starting with a blank whiteboard. Even with 25 years experience in Aerospace, it would be presumptious, and flat out wrong for me to give a powerpoint presentation and say &quot;This is the universal answer to all problems, it will fit your situation&quot;; this is the approach of someone hawking software.</p>

<h1 id="difference-from-sap">Difference from SAP</h1>
<ol>
<li>Diamond client interface is natively HTML5 and all functionality is available in a simple browser, whereas SAP has a cludgy interface, the native interface is client-server, a technology that is embarassingly old fashioned and the implementation is poor, at best https://help.sap.com/doc/saphelp_nw70ehp1/7.01.16/en-US/4d/aeae42cd7fb611e10000000a155106/content.htm?no_cache=true</li>
<li>There are no exposed transaction codes in Diamond, everything is menu driven, reducing training time and simplifying operation efficiency.</li>
<li>SAP has a proprietary database, HANA</li>
<li>Diamond is not complicated it uses International Standards for everything, and the most widely adopted technologies, there is no dependency on anything proprietary unless the oracle database is used.</li>
