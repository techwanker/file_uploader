# Objectives

## What are the primary objectives you wish to achieve?

* Purchasing and planning personnel efficiency.
 
    * Lower Cost of goods
    * Reduced inventory
    * Optimal Stocking Levels by part

* Kitting
  
    * Increased sales through more efficient planning for JIT and SLA contracts
    * Kit production and planning fees
    * Additional revenue from supplying kitting part
 
# Scenarios

## Multi-Certification

Upon determination that an equivalent part is already in stock an attempt should be
made to get the item cross certified.

I will provide hundreds of thousands of equivalent parts; 
It is the responsibility of Align to obtain Certificates of Compliance.
I would expect that you will have thousands if not tens of thousands of lots eligible for multiple-certification.

## Actions
   
Create a spreadsheet with the purchase order number, mfr_lot_nbr, receiver number or
a vendor specific format and request Certifications

### Request Status

   A - Advisory
   R - Request

### Response 

The manufacturer will respond with:
  
* Stamped CofC for all lots
* Stamped CofC per manufacturer lot
* Electronic non image CofC 
* Commitment to provide on demand
* Invalid equivalent
* Not possible
               
#### Imaging

Mfr CofC can be stored in Diamond APS digitally..

If your policy is to have the paper onhand we can create a document number
and you just scan them and file under the system specified document number
which is sequential.  This allows a hundred certs per physical file folder
so they can be pulled, copied and printed on demand.

#### Permissioned Block Chain

Certificates can be maintained on a permissioned block chain, this can
provide proof of custody, but exposes sourcing information to all participants,

## Inter Facility Transfer

## Simulations

If there is inventory available in an alternate facility say, supply with
no demand in LA but there is demand in Paris, It may be desireable to ship 
the inventory to stock in Paris.


Factors to be considered include:

* Cost of item vs Cost of Acquiring
* Duty Cost
* Shipping Cost
* Lead Time for shipping vs Lead Time to buy
         
What is the relationship between European and US operations?   
Would transfers be at actual book value ?
If the inter-company book value signficantly higher or lower than purchase cost
Say Paris says, "not my fault you overpaid for inventory you cannot use."

## Buy Quantity

Factors to be taken into consideration when computing buy quantities and schedule:

* Unsatisfied firm demand
* Unsatisfied Safety Stock
* Unsatisfied forecast / AMC
* Forecast Simulation standard deviation
* Service Levels
* Carrying cost
* Unit Cost for a given quantity
* Float Time (Days to pay, multiple delivery schedule without penalty, consignment after initial)
    
    Isolated by scenario (Approved Mfr etc)
