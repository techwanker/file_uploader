alter pluggable database pdb_name save state;


Oracle will then preserve the mode when you restart the CDB. You can find the current saved state by querying dba_pdb_saved_states. 

If you have several and want them all to open on restart, you can do: 

alter pluggable database all save state;


You can use this to keep the state of all but a few with the except clause: 

alter pluggable database all except pdb_name1, pdb_name2 save state;


Note saving state is only available from 12.1.0.2. If you're on 12.1.0.1 then the trigger is the way to go. 

Examples
--------

SQL> alter pluggable database sales_reporting_pdb open;

Pluggable database altered.

SQL> alter pluggable database sales_reporting_pdb save state;

Pluggable database altered.
