\chapter{Introduction}
You've just been assigned to a new project group that uses some of the most popular development libraries and 
methodologies.

This is a series of lessons designed to quickly give you an introduction to Maven, Spring and Hibernate.
\section{Project Specs}
Design a program to scan a disk drive and store the contents of an MP3 files into an open ended number of formats ad 
\section{Steps}
Download and install Maven.

Create your directories.

create new directory in Eclipse

Domain model

create project 

in eclipse install maven plugin

enable dependence management (show screen shots)

We want to use the features available in version 1.5 of java

A lot of tabs, describe them



plugins

click add

need to add 

Now add the following property

    <junit.version>4.4</junit.version>
because the build tool defaulted to a different version.

Working from the command line so that we can isolate out eclipse configuration problems.

maven from the command line

mvn eclipse:clean
mvn eclipse:eclipse

configure in junit 4.4

\section{installing library}
We have decided to use jidlib now we must install it into our repository

Need to

run src/main/lib/install_jars_to_maven_repository.sh 

Need to change to use java 1.6 but unable to configure through gui in eclipse need to edit pom.

Create a bean for the MP3 metadata 

\section{Design}
Need a bean to hold the information from an MP3 file.
TODO need to preserve tabs
\verbatiminput{../../src/main/java/org/javautil/mp3/MP3MetaData.java}
TODO want to test that it works correctly

test the class

\section{Create the database objects}
Talk about what comes first database objects or domain objects.

\section{Creating an argument Beans}
see javautil-commandline
alter the pom.

Cut and paste this into the pom.
\begin{verbatim}
   <dependency>
                        <groupId>org.javautil</groupId>
                        <artifactId>javautil-commandline</artifactId>
                        <version>${org.javautil.commandline.version}</version>
    </dependency>



\end{verbatim}
Create the bean
Create the properties file, we will show you how to use to process command line arguments later.

configure a log4j.xml in src/test/resources and make sure it gets deployed.

How much have we tested?  Code coverage.

CSV's as test and expected results.

\section{Now what}
Now we have MP3MetaDataExtractorTest how can we configure this another way?

\section{Inject over factories}
public interface Mp3Persistence

How the persistence came into being is not a matter of concern of the application that wishes to store data.

Is it writing to a socket? A database? A file?  Why do I care?

Every one of these implementations require different constuctors 
and or setter methods before than can do their work

\section{write to flat file as }

\section{Implementations}
Document Object Model
Streaming XML
CSV
Excel Workbook
HTML
JASON
Serialized Java Object
JDBC
Hibernate
Service Call
Dataset
EBCDIC

\section{The canonical representation, the domain model}

\chapter{Logging}

\chapter{Private Methods}
\chapter{TODO}
show cascading inherited beans.
